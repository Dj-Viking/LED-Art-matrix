* Running Locally
    - 
    ```sh
        git clone "git@github.com:Dj-Viking/LED-Art-matrix.git"; \
        cd LED-Art-matrix/; \
        npm install --verbose; \
        npm start;
    ```
    - you should at least have the client webpack dev server start and the server will crash without env.txt file. the client doesn't NEED the server just to play around with the LED controls. But for the purposes of using the art scroller and saving LED pattern presets the server needs to work to save user data.
    - ![asdf](./docs/images/start-after-clone.png)
    ## env.txt 
    - have an env.txt file created in the root of project, and one in the server folder. This is for the purpose of allowing server tests to run, regarding password hashing salts and token secrets
    - ```API_KEY='your-giphy-api-key'```
        * allows the app to use giphy api to get the layering gifs activated in the client app art scroller feature.
    - ```SECRET='whatever_you_want_here_definitely_gitignore_this_file!!!'```
        * for use in creating/verifying JWT tokens. 
    - ```EXPIRATION='1h'```
        * time for the login JWT token to expire before user needs to login again or keep navigating pages to refresh the token
    - ```EXPIRED_TOKEN='eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb21lVXVpZCI6IjcxNmYzMzJlLTMxODQtNDJmMC04Y2I3LTRjOWNlNmJmODdkOCIsInVzZXJuYW1lIjoidGVzdC11c2VyIiwiZW1haWwiOiJ0ZXN0QGVtYWlsLmNvbSIsIl9pZCI6IjYxZTIxMzgwNTdjOTc4NGYyNDllNjIzNSIsImlhdCI6MTY0MjIwNjA4MCwiZXhwIjoxNjQyMjA5NjgwfQ.kShMP7vYDqYvw-raT1WUq1_XVD4LgU9YsJBZ_8qAqpM'```
        * expired JWT token for the purpose of testing
    - ```INVALID_SIGNATURE='eyJfsdhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb21lVXVpZCI6IjcxNmYzMzJlLTMxODQtNDJmMC04Y2I3LTRjOWNlNmJmODdkOCIsInVzZXJuYW1lIjoidGVzdC11c2VyIiwiZW1haWwiOiJ0ZXN0QGVtYWlsLmNvbSIsIl9pZCI6IjYxZTIxMzgwNTdjOTc4NGYyNDllNjIzNSIsImlhdCI6MTY0MjIwNjA4MCwiZXhwIjoxNjQyMjA5NjgwfQ.kShMP7vYDqYvw-raT1WUq1_XVD4LgU9YsJBZ_8qAqpM'```
        * invalid JWT token signature for the purpose of testing
    - ```SALT='12'```
        * read about bcrypt password hashing <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46693430/what-are-salt-rounds-and-how-are-salts-stored-in-bcrypt" target="_blank">salt rounds</a>
    - ```RESET_EXPIRATION='5m'```
        * the expiration time for the reset password email token to expire before the user has to make a new password reset request
    - ```NODEMAILER_AUTH_EMAIL='<REDACTED>'```
    - ```NODEMAILER_AUTH_PASS='<REDACTED>'```
    - ```OTHER_NODEMAILER_AUTH_PASS='<REDACTED>'```


    ## NodeMailer
    - Not completely necessary for local setup, but if you want to test it yourself, you'll need to set up a gmail account that has app access rights to allow code executed inside nodejs to use a particular email to transport a message to the user's entered email. Which allows the user a short period of time to reset their password.
    - the jest test for this email feature has a mocked function that does not send the email during the server test. 

    ## Testing
    - must have env.txt created and located in the right directories for the server tests to pass. the client tests should be self contained
    - and you can see the istanbul coverage report by going into the coverage folders inside server and client folders to see line coverage.
    - If anybody knows a better way to do dependency injection for the MIDI controller testing I am looking for some help on this!
    ```sh
    # working directory should be the root folder of project
    npm test
    ```
